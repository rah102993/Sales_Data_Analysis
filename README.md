# Sales_Data_Analysis
An interactive Sales Dashboard designed to draw some meaningful insights.

PURPOSE: Analyse sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

While working on this project, I was able to;
- Explore sales trends over time,
- Identify the best-selling products,
- Calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and
- Create visualizations to present my findings effectively.
